  <h1>Cody VanGosen - CS-499 ePortfolio</h1>
  <p>This portfolio serves as the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. It highlights enhanced artifacts that demonstrate my proficiency in software design, algorithm development, and database integration. Accompanying narratives and a professional self-assessment provide insight into my learning journey, technical skills, and future career aspirations.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üß≠ Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>This formal self-assessment provides a comprehensive overview of my personal and academic growth throughout the computer science program. It emphasizes my technical strengths, career goals, and ability to work collaboratively in diverse environments. It serves as an introduction to the portfolio and demonstrates how I connect the coursework to professional development goals.</p>

    <h2>üß™ Code Review</h2>
    <p>My code review provides a detailed walkthrough of the original artifact before enhancement. It includes analysis of core functionality, structure, and opportunities for improvement in performance, organization, and documentation. The accompanying video outlines the rationale behind each enhancement plan, directly tied to course outcomes and industry-relevant practices.</p>

    <h2>üîß Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
    <p>This enhancement demonstrates significant improvements to a C++ OpenGL-based 3D rendering application originally developed for CS-330. The goal was to restructure the rendering logic for better readability, scalability, and modularity while preserving the intended visual fidelity. I introduced data abstraction using C++ structs, reduced redundancy with loop-based drawing, and implemented a scene graph using custom SceneNode classes. These improvements enable future extensibility for additional objects and features, while also aligning with clean code practices and OOP principles. According to my Milestone Two Narrative, these changes helped satisfy course outcomes related to software design and collaborative maintainability, and directly improved the efficiency of future enhancements.</p>

    <h2>üìä Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>My second enhancement focuses on advanced algorithmic problem-solving and data structure optimization, applied to the same OpenGL rendering artifact. Specifically, I implemented recursive scene traversal through a hierarchical SceneNode tree and used spatial reasoning to dynamically manage the transformations of furniture and food objects. I also improved lighting realism through a physically based rendering technique known as percentage closer filtering (PCF). These algorithmic strategies supported efficient rendering of dynamic components while maintaining runtime performance. This milestone reflects mastery of recursive algorithms, transformation stack logic, and trade-off management, as emphasized in my Enhancement Two journal and narrative.</p>

    <h2>üóÉÔ∏è Enhancement 3: Databases</h2>
    <p>For this enhancement, I focused on developing a MongoDB-integrated dashboard using Dash and JupyterDash. The goal was to demonstrate CRUD operations, dynamic UI components, and map-based visualization for an animal shelter dataset. Enhancements involved implementing callbacks, visual filters, and interactive displays, showing proficiency in full-stack data handling and presentation.</p>

    <h2>üìì Journals & Supporting Work</h2>
    <p>This enhancement focuses on integrating persistent data storage into a classic OpenGL-based brick breaker game originally developed in CS-330. The core improvement was the implementation of a high score system using a JSON file to manage player records, paired with dynamic UI prompts for user interaction. The program now records initials and scores after a game session, with real-time display updates for top performers. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to serialize and manage structured data outside of a traditional RDBMS, showcasing skills in file-based database simulation, interactive data I/O, and user-driven state transitions. According to my Milestone Four Narrative and Journal, this solution exemplifies practical application of database logic using lightweight formats, while ensuring performance, cross-platform compatibility, and user experience enhancements‚Äîall without the need for a server-based backend.</p>
