# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone Portfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio for the CS-499 Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio represents the culmination of my academic journey through the computer science program and showcases my ability to apply technical knowledge to solve real-world problems through thoughtful design, algorithmic reasoning, and data-driven development.

Throughout this capstone project, I revisited and enhanced three key artifacts that span the domains of software design, algorithm development, and database integration. These enhancements reflect my growth as a developer and my ability to meet industry-aligned standards for modularity, maintainability, performance, and user experience.

This repository includes:
- 🔧 **Refactored C++ OpenGL rendering projects** with scalable architecture and recursive scene graphs
- 🧠 **Algorithmic improvements** to increase performance and visual realism through optimized transformations and lighting techniques
- 🗃️ **JSON-based database integration** into a game environment for persistent state tracking and user interaction

I also include:
- 📄 Formal **narratives** explaining the technical improvements behind each enhancement
- 📘 Weekly **journal entries** that reflect my progress, decisions, and lessons learned during each stage of the capstone
- ✅ A professional self-assessment that ties my academic experience to career goals and workplace performance

> This portfolio is designed not only to demonstrate my technical skills, but also to serve as a professional artifact I can present to future employers and collaborators.

## 🔍 Featured Enhancements

Each section of the portfolio corresponds to one of the three core competencies and is housed within the corresponding module folder:

| Category                         | Project Summary                                                                                            | Location               |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Software Design**              | Refactored a 3D OpenGL scene using a modular scene graph with hierarchical transformation logic.           | `Module Three/`        |
| **Algorithms & Data Structures** | Optimized recursive traversal and matrix-based lighting in OpenGL with performance tuning.                 | `Module Four/`         |
| **Databases**                    | Implemented JSON-based file persistence for a game to store and retrieve user high scores dynamically.     | `Module Five/`         |

Each module includes:
- Initial source code prior to enhancement
- Final source code after improvement
- A narrative document describing the enhancement process
